Hello!

I decided to create a GitHub Repo for my ModPE Scripts, so everyone can easily see the code, and you can post edits or requests you would like implemented. Also, it allows the import via Web Address method to be used.

Please don't copy or claim these scripts as your own. You can release your own versions of these scripts, but give me credit and post a link to my forum too.
